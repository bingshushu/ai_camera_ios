ONNX Model Placeholder

To complete the setup:
1. Place your trained YOLOv8 ONNX model file here as "model.onnx"
2. The model should be trained for circle detection with classes: "ROI" and "RedCenter"
3. Expected input shape: [1, 3, H, W] where H=W (square input, typically 320x320 or 640x640)
4. Expected output shape: [1, 6, N] where 6 = 4(bbox) + 2(classes)

Model requirements:
- Input: RGB image normalized to [0,1]
- Output: YOLOv8 format with bounding boxes and class probabilities
- Classes: 0="ROI", 1="RedCenter"
- Optimized for mobile inference (quantized recommended)

You can export your model from Python using:
```python
from ultralytics import YOLO
model = YOLO('your_trained_model.pt')
model.export(format='onnx', imgsz=320, optimize=True)
```
